Additional data, when available, for samples in IOP database 
Mass concentrations of dry Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Chlorophyll-a (Chla), and Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) retained on 25 mm diameter glass fiber filters Whatman Grade GF/F
SPM was determined following a gravimetric method using pre-washed and pre-weighted filters with a 1 µg resolution scale (van der Linde, 1998) 
POC was determined on precombusted filters with a standard CHN analysis involving high temperature combustion of sample filters (Parsons et al., 1984) 
Chla was determined spectrophotometrically with acetone extractions following Ritchie (2008); see also Koestner et al. (2018)
