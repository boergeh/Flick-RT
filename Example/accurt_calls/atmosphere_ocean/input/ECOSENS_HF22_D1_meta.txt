/* Hardangerfjord Water Sample.
Mass concentrations of dry Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) 
and Chlorophyll-a (Chla) retained on 47 mm diameter glass fiber 
filters Whatman Grade GF/F. SPM was determined following a 
gravimetric method using pre-washed and pre-weighted filters 
(van der Linde, 1998). Chla was determined fluorometrically 
with methanol extractions following Holm-Hansen and Riemann (1978).
Instrument: Turner 10-AU Field Fluorometer
Exciation/Emission: 436/680 nm 

Time point (Row 3) and Number of days (Row 4) are times of Ramses 
TriOS radiance and irradiance measurements.
