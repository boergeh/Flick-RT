Flick needs environmental variables to be set in your shell
configuration script, e.g., .zprofile if you are using zsh or
.profile if you are using bash. You can check what shell your are
using with

 echo $SHELL

For example, if you are using zsh, you can append the needed lines in
.zprofile by running the following three commands

 echo 'export FLICK_PATH=$HOME/flick' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'export FLICK_COMPILER="clang++ -std=c++20"' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'export PATH=$FLICK_PATH/main:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile

and activate the .zprofile script by

 source ~/.zprofile

In the export commands above, change $HOME/flick to include the path
to where you have stored your copy of Flick if it is not in your home
directory. If you want to change compiler or compiler options, replace
"clang++ -std=c++20" with for example "g++ -O2 -std=c++20". You may of
course also open and edit .zprofile with a text editor. If you are
using bash, replace ~/.zprofile with ~/.profile.
