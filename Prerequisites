Flick RT needs environmental variables to be set in your shell
configuration script, e.g., .zprofile if you are using zsh or
.profile if you are using bash. You can check what shell your are
using with

 echo $SHELL

If you are using zsh, you can append the needed lines in
.zprofile by running the following three commands

 echo 'export FLICK_PATH=$HOME/Flick-RT' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'export FLICK_COMPILER="clang++ -std=c++20"' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'export PATH=$FLICK_PATH/main:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile

and activate the .zprofile script by

 source ~/.zprofile

If you are using bash, you can append the needed lines in
.profile by running the following three commands

 echo 'export FLICK_PATH=$HOME/Flick-RT' >> ~/.profile
 echo 'export FLICK_COMPILER="g++ -std=c++20"' >> ~/.profile
 echo 'export PATH=$FLICK_PATH/main:$PATH' >> ~/.profile

and activate the .profile script by

 source ~/.profile

In the export commands above, change $HOME/Flick-RT to include the
path to where you have stored your copy of Flick, if it is not in your
home directory. You may of course also open and edit .zprofile or
.profile with a text editor.
