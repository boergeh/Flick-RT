Flick needs environmental variables to be set in your shell
configuration script, e.g., .zprofile if you use zsh or
.profile if you use bash. You can check what shell your are
using with

 echo "$SHELL"

For example, if use zsh, you can append the needed lines in .zprofile
by running the following three commands

 echo "export FLICK_PATH=$HOME/flick" >> ~/.zprofile
 echo "export FLICK_COMPILER=\"clang++ -std=c++20\"" >> ~/.zprofile
 echo "export PATH=$FLICK_PATH/main:$PATH" >> ~/.zprofile

and activate the expanded script by

 source ~/.zprofile

In the commands above, change $HOME/flick to include the path to where
you have stored your copy of Flick if it is not in your home
directory. If you want to change compiler or compiler options, replace
"clang++ -std=c++20" with for example "g++ -O2 -std=c++20". You may of
course also open and edit .zprofile with a text editor. For other
shells, such as bash, or other desired shell scripts, replace .zprofile
with e.g., ~/.profile.
