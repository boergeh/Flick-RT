Add the three lines given below to your shell configuration script,
e.g., .zprofile or .zshrc if you run zsh, .profile or .bashrc if you
run bash. Check shell with echo "$SHELL". Create shell script file if
it does not exist.

 export FLICK_PATH=$HOME/flick
 export FLICK_COMPILER="clang++ -std=c++20"
 export PATH=$FLICK_PATH/main:$PATH

Change $HOME/flick to include the path to where you have stored your
copy of Flick if it is not in your home directory. In case you want to
change compiler or compiler options, replace "clang++ -std=c++20" with
for example "g++ -O2 -std=c++20".

Activate script with

 source ~/.zprofile

or source ~/.zshrc, source ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc depending on your
shell type.
