Add the following three lines to your shell configuration script,
e.g., .zshrc, .zprofile or .bashrc.

 export FLICK_PATH=$HOME/your_path/flick
 export FLICK_COMPILER="clang++ -std=c++20"
 export PATH=$FLICK_PATH/main:$PATH

Replace your_path with the path to where you have stored your copy of
Flick. Change clang++ -std=c++20 if you want to use another compiler
or add other compiler options, for example, "g++ -O2 -std=c++20".

Then activate the changes by

 source ~/.zshrc

or source ~/.zprofile or source ~/.bashrc, depending on your choice of shell.
