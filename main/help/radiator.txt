flick radiator <parameters>

parameters:

  radiator planck <temperature> <number of wavelengths>

    Black-body irradiance spectrum versus wavelength radiated from a
    surface with a given temperature and an emissivity of one. The
    unit is W m^-3, following the SI-unit convection. 1 W m^-3
    corresponds to 1e9 W m^-2 nm^-1.

Example:

  flick radiator planck 6000 20

Remember: unless other units are explicitly stated, Flick is always
using SI units for input and output of physical values,
