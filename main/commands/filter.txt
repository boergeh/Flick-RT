Command:

  flick filter <irradiance_file_name> <filter_name> [filter_specific_parameters ...]

  Filters and integrates an irradiance spectrum.

Parameters:

  <irradiance_file_name>

    Name of ascii text file containing two columns, one with
    wavelengths and one with spectral irradiance values.
    
  <filter_name> [filter_specific_parameter ...]

    Select among the following filters with corresponding paramters:

    'uv_index' 

    'uva_index'

    'uvb_index'

    'gaussian_mean' <center_wavelength> <full_width_half_maximum>

    'weighted_integral' <file_name_of_tabulated_filter_transmittance> 

Examples:

  flick filter ./toa_solar.txt uv_index

  flick filter ./toa_solar.txt gaussian_mean 500e-9 10e-9
  
  flick filter ./toa_solar.txt weighted_integral ./my_transmittance.txt


Remember: unless other units are explicitly stated, Flick is always
using SI units (m, kg, s) for input and output of physical values, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units.
