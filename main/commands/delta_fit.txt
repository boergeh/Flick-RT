Command:

  flick delta_fit <number_of_terms> <argument> <phase_function_file_name>

Parameters:

 <phase_function_file_name>

    Name of a two-column text file, where the first column contains
    cosine of the scattering angle in the range -1 to 1, and the
    second column contains phase function values normalized such that
    the integrated area under the curve is 1/(2*pi). Note that the
    integrated phase function over all 4*pi solid angles will then be
    unity.

Example 1:

  flick delta_fit 10 coefficients petzold_phase_function.txt

  Lists 10 Legendre expansion term coefficients, a_l, such that the
  relative difference between the input tabulated Petzold phase
  function and f = sum a_l * P_l is as small as possible, where P_l is
  the Legendre polynomials. The first listed coefficient, a_0, equals
  half the area under the fitted phase function curve. k = 4*pi*a_0 is
  therfore the scaling factor for the scattering coefficient, and each
  of the 10 expansion coefficient should be divided by k in order to
  be used together with the scaled scattering coefficient.

Example 2:

  flick delta_fit 10 function_values petzold_phase_function.txt

  Lists a 10-term fitted phase function. First output column contains
  cosine of scattering angel and second column contains function
  values.

Remember: Unless other units are explicitly stated, Flick is always
using SI units (m, kg, s) for input and output of physical values, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units.
