  Lorenz-Mie C++ calculator. It is implemented based on (1)
  Mishchenko, M.I. and Yang, P., 2018. Far-field Lorenz–Mie scattering
  in an absorbing host mediumm... Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy
  and Radiative Transfer, 205, pp.241-252. (2) Mishchenko, M.I.,
  Dlugach, J.M., Lock, J.A. and Yurkin, M.A., 2018. Far-field
  Lorenz–Mie scattering in an absorbing host medium. II: Improved
  stability of the numerical algorithm. Journal of Quantitative
  Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, 217, pp.274-277. In addition,
  an extension has been implemented which dynamically integrates over
  a log-normal size distribution, searching for integration limits and
  number of integration points until a given accuracy is
  obtained. When the distribution width approaches zero, a full double
  precision output accuracy is always provided.

Parameters:
	
  <median_radius>

    exp(mu), where mu is the expected value of the natural
    log-transform radii,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution
    
  <size_distribution_width>	

    sigma, which is the standard deviation of the natural
    log-transformed radii,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution.
    
  <output_kind> [output_specific_parameters]...

    Select among the following output with corresponding paramters:

    'absorption_cross_section' 

    'scattering_cross_section'

    'scattering_matrix_element' <row> <column> <number_of_angles>

     where the cross sections are given as averaged values after
     integrating over the normalized log-normal size distribution, and
     where absorption and scattering coefficients can be obtained by
     multiplying the averaged cross sections with the total number of
     particles in a unit volume (in one m^3). <row> and <column> are
     integers ranging from zero to three. Note that the scattering
     matrix is given such that the integral over 4*pi steradians of
     element (0,0) equals the scattering cross section.

     Note also that the absorption cross section should be negative
     when the imaginary part of the refractive index is larger for the
     host than for the spheres, as less light will be lost from a beam
     traveling through the host medium when these particles are
     present, e.g. when transparent bubbles are added in water.

Examples:

  flick mie 500e-9 1.3+1e-5i 1.0 1e-6 0.01 5 absorption_cross_section

  flick mie 500e-9 1.3+1e-5i 1.0 1e-6 0.01 5 scattering_cross_section

  flick mie 500e-9 1.3+1e-5i 1.0 1e-6 0.01 5 scattering_matrix_element 0 0 10


Remember: unless other units are explicitly given, Flick is always
using SI units (m, kg, s) for input and output of physical values, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units.
