Command:

  flick accurt [options] <configuration_file>

  The accurt command can only be used if the radiative transfer code
  AccuRT (http://www.geminor.com/accurt.html) is already installed.

Parameters:

  [options]

    -g <configuration_type>

    Include this option for generation of a configuration file with
    default settings.

    <configuration_type>

      'toa_reflectance' for top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectrum
      [1/sr], where the nadir radiance is divided by the downwelling
      irradiance. With ocean.

      'boa_transmittance' for a bottom-of-atmosphere transmittance
      spectrum [unitless], where the downwelling irradiance at the
      ground is divided by the downwelling irradiance at the top of
      the atmosphere. Without ocean.

      'rs_reflectance' for remote sensing reflectance [1/sr], where
      nadir radiance is divided by downwelling irradiance and the
      direct ocean surface reflectance component is subtracted.

      'ramses_reflectance' [1/sr] for simulation of a typical Ramses
      radiometer setup, where the upward looking irradiance senor is
      placed higher than the downward looking radiance sensor. With
      ocean.

  <configuration_file>

    The configuration file is an ASCII text file containing a list of
    all changeable input parameters. A configuration file with default
    settings will be generated by the -g option.

Examples:

  flick accurt -g toa_reflectance my_config

  flick accurt my_config

  flick accurt my_config > my_output_file.txt
