Command:

  flick accurt <output> <configuration_file_name>

  The accurt command can only be used if the radiative transfer code
  AccuRT (http://www.geminor.com/accurt.html) is already installed.

Parameters:

  <output>
  
     Select 'toa_reflectance' or 'boa_transmittance'

     The 'toa_reflectance' option will generate a top-of-atmosphere
     reflectance spectrum [1/sr], where the nadir radiance is divided
     by the downwelling irradiance.

     The 'boa_transmittance' option will generate a
     bottom-of-atmosphere transmittance spectrum [unitless], where the
     downwelling irradiance at the ground is divided by the
     downwelling irradiance at the top of the atmosphere.

  <configuration_file_name>

    The configuration file is an ASCII text file containing a list of
    all changeable input parameters. If this file does not exist in
    the current directory, it will be generate automatically during
    the first run.

Examples:

  flick accurt toa_reflectance my_config

  flick accurt toa_reflectance my_config > output_to_my_file.txt
