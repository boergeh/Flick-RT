flick radiator <name> [argument ...]

  Lists irradiance spectrum versus wavelength for a given
  radiator. Following Flick's SI-unit convention, the unit of
  irradiance is W m^-3, where 1 W m^-3 corresponds to 1e-9 W m^-2
  nm^-1.

Usage 1:

  flick radiator planck <temperature> <number_of_points>

  Black-body spectrum from a surface with a given temperature.

  Example:
    
  flick radiator planck 6000 20

Usage 2:

  flick radiator toa-solar 

  Top-of-atmosphere solar irradiance spectrum at normal incidence at
  average Sun-Earth distance.

  Example:

  flick radiator toa-solar


Remember: unless other units are explicitly stated, Flick is always
using SI units for input and output of physical values,
