Flick RT (Flick for short) is a general code for radiative transfer calculations.

Clone from GitHub with:  
 git clone https://github.com/boergeh/Flick-RT.git  

For macOS and Linux:

 cd Flick-RT -- to enter the Flick-RT directory  

 make -- to compile and test  

 flick help -- for further documentation and usage examples  

You will need to have a c++ compiler (e.g. clang++ or g++) already
install, and the first time Flick is compiled, you will be instructed
how to set necessary environmental variables.

The name Flick is inspired by flickering of a candle and the flick
unit occasionally used for spectral radiance, where one flick equals
one watt per steradian per square centimeter of surface per micrometer
of span in wavelength.
